C195 Appointment Management Project

The purpose of the project is to pull data from a database to allow adding, updating, and deleting customers and appointments. It also converts times to different timezones depending on the users timezone and converts the login screen to English and French, depending on the users settings.

The report I chose calculates how many customers are in each Country. On the reports page you can select one of the three available Countries. When a Country is selected, it prints out text to the right of the combobox selection stating how many customers there are in the selected Country.
